- You've reached Visage's Github. Dotfiles and more incoming.. re-vamping my dotfiles and config.
- I’m interested in OSINT, threat intelligence, penetration testing and red teaming, how to write good documentation, and other fun security stuff.
- I'm currently learning bash scripting, offensive security, and am always learning about OSINT and Linux in general. 
- I'm looking to collaborate on OSINT tooling, bash scripts, or your neat, small tools. 
- I like learning about what you've done to optimize your security program, threat model, or operating system.
